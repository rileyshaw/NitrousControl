# NitrousControl
Nitrous control is an embedded system project used for providing a simple way to control nitrous flow to a given automotive based on RPM and other factors of the given system. The system is using an atmel chip to efficiently recieve input, make computations and allow the user to set parameters, and send the computed percentages to the nitrous solenoid. The project is written in C using a given atmel IDE which allowed for simple flashing to the micro-processor.
